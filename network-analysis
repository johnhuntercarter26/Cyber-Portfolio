# Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)

## Objective
Capture and analyze real network traffic to understand common protocols and communication patterns.

## Method
Live traffic capture on a personal machine using Wireshark.

## Key Observations
- DNS queries occur before most web connections
- HTTPS traffic is encrypted and unreadable at the payload level
- TCP three-way handshakes establish reliable connections
- Background services generate constant network traffic

## Tools Used
- Wireshark

## Key Takeaways
- Encryption protects data in transit
- Unencrypted protocols expose readable data
- Traffic analysis can reveal behavior patterns even when payloads are encrypted
